    "Answer:<br>\n",
    "Functions are \"self contained\" modules of code that accomplish a specific task. Functions usually \"take in\" data, process it, and \"return\" a result. Once a function is written, it can be used over and over and over again. Functions can be \"called\" from the inside of other functions."

Using the output from one function call as the input to another. A statement that creates a new function, specifying its name, parameters, and the statements it executes."

    "There's only one global Python scope per program execution. This scope remains in existence until the program terminates and all its names are forgotten. <br>\n",
    "When you use an unqualified name inside a function, Python searches three scopes—the local (L), then the global (G), and then the built-in (B)—and stops at the first place the name is found."
